# Introduction

Animations are an important part of a website, and when implemented correctly deliver a good user experience.
Although there exists some animation libraries which work with React, we are going to take a look at [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) a great animation library which is based on physics (yes you read that right) instead of durations.

The need for this post arose when I tried to animate an svg using _react-spring_ but I could not find a good resource from start to finish. Although _react-spring_ documents on [animating an svg](https://www.react-spring.io/docs/props/spring) implementing it as is, will not work as a number of parameters required such as svg path length, stroke dash array, etc are not mentioned.

So, let us begin!

# Setup

1. Begin by typing

```
npx create-react-app react-spring-demo
```

in your terminal. Go inside the created project and install react-spring by typing `npm install --save react-spring`

2. Type

```
npm run start
```

in terminal to start the React app. Go to `src` directory and create a new file `Animation.js` which will contain the animation code.

3. Remove everything from `App.js` and import `Animation.js`. Inside `Animation.js` type a simple hello world program as a placeholder.

Below is `App.js`

```js
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import Animation from './Animation';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Animation />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Below is `Animation.js`

```js
//Animation.js
import React from 'react';

const Animation = () => {
  return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
};

export default Animation;
```

# Animation

1. Replace the code in `Animation.js` by the following code

```js
// Animation.js
import React, { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

const Animation = () => {
  const pathRef = useRef();

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(pathRef.current.getTotalLength());
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <svg>
        <circle
          strokeWidth="3"
          cx="100"
          cy="50"
          r="40"
          stroke="black"
          fill="none"
          ref={pathRef}
        />
      </svg>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Animation;
```
